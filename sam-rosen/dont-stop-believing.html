        <h1>Don't Stop Believing</h1>
        <h2>Journey</h2>
            <p>Just a small town girl<br>Livin' in a lonely world<br>She took the midnight train<br>Goin' anywhere<br>Just a city boy<br>Born and raised in South Detroit<br>He took the midnight train<br>Goin' anywhere<br></p>
            <p>A singer in a smokey room<br>The smell of wine and cheap perfume<br>For a smile they can share the night<br>It goes on and on, and on, and on<br></p>
            <p>Strangers waiting<br>Up and down the boulevard<br>Their shadows searching<br>In the night<br>Streetlight people<br>Livin' just to find emotion<br>Hidin' somewhere in the night<br></p>
            <p>Workin' hard to get my fill<br>Everybody wants a thrill<br>Payin' anything to roll the dice<br>Just one more time<br>Some will win<br>Some will lose<br>Some were born to sing the blues<br>Oh, the movie never ends<br>It goes on and on, and on, and on<br></p>
            <p>Strangers waiting<br>Up and down the boulevard<br>Their shadows searching<br>In the night<br>Streetlight people<br>Livin' just to find emotion<br>Hidin' somewhere in the night<br></p>
            <p>Don't stop believin'<br>Hold on to that feelin'<br>Streetlight people<br>Don't stop believin'<br>Hold on<br>Streetlight people<br>Don't stop believin'<br>Hold on to that feelin'<br>Streetlight people<br></p>
